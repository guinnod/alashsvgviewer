jscut
=====

A simple CAM package that runs in the browser.

Live version at http://jscut.org/jscut.html

The master branch tends to be stale; the gh-pages branch is current, including bug fixes. The live version pulls from gh-pages.

Successor
=======

[LaserWeb4](https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb4) is the successor to jscut. I no longer add new features to jscut.
